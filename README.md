# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical input data using a trained machine learning model.

## 🔍 Overview
- Built using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and StandardScaler
- Trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset
- Implements logistic regression / decision tree / random forest (mention which)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is publicly available and was taken from: [link to Kaggle/UCI]

## ⚙️ Features Used
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

## 🧠 How it Works
- Data is preprocessed (missing values handled, standardized)
- Model is trained on 80% of the data
- Tested on 20% of the data
- Accuracy score is 78%

## 📈 Output
The model prints whether a person is diabetic or not based on user input.

## 🛠️ Installation & Running
